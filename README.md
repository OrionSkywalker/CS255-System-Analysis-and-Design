# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design
## This is a sample of work completed during the fall of 2021 for SNHU CS-255 Systems Analysis and Design
## Reflection:
* ## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
* ### "You work for a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. Your project lead has assigned you to a new client, DriverPass. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wants your help in designing a system that can handle these needs."
* ## What did you do particularly well?
* ### I think that I was able to design good models of the data, the user, and user activity, and these would easily translate into a concrete system that is clearly defined.
* ## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
* ### I think that revisions of each model could be useful, the improvements would involve adding more iterations to the design so that the final product is fine tuned without conceptual errors.
* ## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
* ### The users needs were communicated via the client's description of the nature of the system. The development must be geared toward the end users needs while using the system to achieve the desired outcome.
* ## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
* ### I approach software design by considering the raw functionality requested. This raw functionality is translated into user stories that clearly state the user goals while using the software. Each user goal is met by the system. If improvements are requested of an exisiting system, the system must be examined for unnecessary or overcomplicated functions and the system data flows and activities are optimized. An object model goes on to describe the interactions between objects that exist in the system and, finally, code is produced that is oriented toward the objects previously defined.
